<em>This post is the second in a series of posts about managing a programmer job hunt (including hunting for a job in another city).  You might be interested in the other parts:

### After the initial research
 - We needed to save up to move.  We knew that because we were moving such a long distance away, we should save up a pretty sizeable moving fund (because long distance moves are freaking expensive)
 - We saved for an interview trip for me -- I was going to have to land a job somehow, and phone interviews are a good foot in the door, but they're not going to close the deal
 - By a stroke of genius we decided "Hey -- we should actually go for a week sometime way before we start the process and actually make sure we really want to go there".  This turned out to be awesome. 
 - I kept an eye on the job market (and compared to the local job market) by subscribing to <a href="http://techtalk.dice.com/t5/Customer-Support/create-custom-rss-feed/td-p/233298" target="_blank">Dice's RSS feeds</a>.  Again, for a rough comparison I used the keyword "C#" for both job markets and just watched how many jobs accrued each week in each market.  I was able to see that Atlanta consistently had 3-4 times as many jobs offered in a week as Phoenix did.  Every week.  For the entire year leading up to the move.  This gave me incredible confidence when actually starting the application process.
 - I was very open with my work as soon as we started targeting Atlanta.  Not everyone's work environment is the same.  I had been working with a company that was very good to me for 8 years.  I felt they deserved to know what my family's plans were, so I kept them in the loop.  I even lobbied to be able to work from home (in Atlanta) prior to starting the job seeking process (but that didn't work out).  In the end, I had incredible peace of mind leaving the company, knowing that I had effectively given them months and months of notice.
	
### The first trip out
We created research packets for 5 cities around the metro area that we knew we wanted to target.  
These packets included a 'target house' on <a href="http://www.zillow.com" target="_blank">Zillow</a>

Within a 10 mile radius of the house, we found:
 
 - Local schools
 - Public library
 - Grocery stores (Costco, etc)
 - Gyms
 - Churches
 - Parks
 - Restaurants


After we arrived, we used <a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> on our mobile phones to find highly rated local restaurants to visit to get a sense of 'local flavor'.  

This 'scouting trip' gave my wife and I a good sense of what was in each of the cities surrounding metro Atlanta, and was vital to our sanity during the move.
