<p>
One of the tools I have found quite handy to have at my fingertips is the excellent <a href="http://api.jquery.com/browser/">jQuery API browser</a>.  Unfortunately, this link is very difficult to find the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">loads of documentation currently available</a> for jQuery.  </p>

<p>Want to make it even easier to get to?  Make a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95710">chrome 'application shortcut'</a> from this and put it somewhere on your desktop (like I do) -- or use the installable Adobe Air version available after clicking the link.</p>
