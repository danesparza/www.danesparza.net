Using the free and excellent service Remember the Milk as your tasklist is great -- but sometimes you need a nice simple tasklist you can keep close at hand on your desktop.  

If you use Google Chrome as your browser, there is a very easy way to do this.  

In Chrome, visit:

http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/modules/googleig/

(this should bring up your task list in Remember the Milk in a tiny view)

Then in Chrome, select the 'wrench' icon, select 'Tools', and then select 'Create Application Shortcuts'.  The next screen to come up will ask you where you'd like to launch your tasklist from.  

Press 'create' and you're all done!
